                    But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of 
                    denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you 
                    a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings

                    No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is 
                    pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences
                    that are extremely painful.

                    Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain,
                    but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.
                    To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it?
                    But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences,
                    or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand,
                    we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike 
                    men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment,
                    so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee
