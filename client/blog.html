                can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise,
                except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure
                that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
                On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and
