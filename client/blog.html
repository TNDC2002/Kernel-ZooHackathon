                            rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires
                            to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain
                            can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise,
